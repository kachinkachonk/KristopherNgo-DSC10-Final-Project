    "\n",
    "**Be careful**: even though you'll be comparing two groups, not all characters will necessarily fall into one of those two groups, as some variables have more than two distinct values. When calling `permutation_test`, make sure that the DataFrame you give it only has rows for the two groups that you're trying to compare, otherwise the results of your permutation test will be invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: All you need to do for Question 4 is set each of the variables in the table above to 1, 2, or 3. You'll do this in the cells provided. Of course, you'll need to do some work to figure out the correct answer choice. Please follow these instructions:\n",

    "- Assign the variable to the correct answer choice in the cell provided.\n",
    "- Before you submit, convert any cells you added to 'Raw NBConvert' format. To change the format of a cell, click the down arrow next to the word 'Code' in the top menu and select 'Raw NBConvert' from the dropdown menu. If you need to modify your work later, you can convert these cells back to code. Make sure that any cells you added are in 'Raw NBConvert' format before submitting, but that the cells that we originally provided you with are still in the original 'Code' format.\n",

    "As we mentioned earlier, the `permutation_test` function is very slow to run on our datasets, since they are so large. You'll have to run `permutation_test` to determine the correct answer to each of the four subparts of this question, but by following the steps above, you'll ensure that your submission will run quickly on the Gradescope autograder."

    "### Question 6: Nonbinary characters 🏳️‍🌈\n",
    "\n",
    "Lately, Marvel has come under scrutiny for having very few nonbinary characters. A nonbinary individual is someone who does not identify as male or female. Marvel's CEO responds to the criticism with a statement emphasizing their commitment to enhancing character diversity. As part of this statement, the CEO states that while the proportion of their characters that are neither male nor female is admittedly small, that's just a reflection of reality, since the proportion of nonbinary people in the United States is small. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's investigate this claim by looking at some data. To start, let's determine the proportion of Americans that are nonbinary. A recent pioneering study by the [Williams Institute at UCLA](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/nonbinary-lgbtq-adults-us/) estimated the number of nonbinary American adults to be 1.2 million. According to the [2020 US Census](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/united-states-adult-population-grew-faster-than-nations-total-population-from-2010-to-2020.html#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20the%20U.S.%20Census,from%20234.6%20million%20in%202010.), there are 258.3 million American adults. Thus, the proportion of American adults that are nonbinary is:"

    "**Question 6.3.** (3 points) Now, implement the bootstrap procedure to create an array called `boot_proportions` containing 10,000 estimates for the proportion of nonbinary Marvel characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using `.sample` with `replace=True` like you'd normally do for bootstrapping, here's a clever strategy that allows you to calculate resample proportions without the `.sample` method, which can be slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the `'NONBINARY'` column contains only 0s and 1s and bootstrapping requires us to sample with replacement, this means each element of our resample has a certain probability of being a 0 and some other probability of being a 1. These probabilities should add up to one. You can think of resampling from a sample of 0's and 1's as a lot like flipping a biased coin. You can find the proportion of 1's in your resample in much the same way you might find the proportion of heads in many coin flips, using `np.random.multinomial`. (It's also possible to do this with `np.random.choice`, but please use `np.random.multinomial` here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This alternate strategy adds up to a huge time savings. With `.sample`, it takes about 1 minute to do 100 repetitions of the bootstrap on a DataFrame of this size, which means to do 10,000 repetitions, it would take about 100 minutes (over an hour 🥱). With `np.random.multinomial`, you should be able to do 10,000 repetitions of the bootstrap in only a few seconds!\n",

    "1. Select Kernel -> Restart & Run All to ensure that you have executed all cells, including the test cells.\n",
    "2. Read through the notebook to make sure everything is fine and all tests passed.\n",
